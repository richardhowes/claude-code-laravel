description: Execute production-quality implementation with strict standards
---

üö® **CRITICAL WORKFLOW - NO SHORTCUTS!** üö®

You are tasked with implementing: $ARGUMENTS

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE:**
1. üîç **RESEARCH FIRST** - "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing"
2. üìã **PLAN** - Present a detailed plan and verify approach
3. ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENT** - Execute with validation checkpoints

**YOU MUST SAY:** "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

For complex tasks, say: "Let me ultrathink about this architecture before proposing a solution."

**USE MULTIPLE AGENTS** when the task has independent parts:
"I'll spawn agents to tackle different aspects of this problem"

Consult ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md IMMEDIATELY and follow it EXACTLY.

**Critical Requirements:**

üõë **HOOKS ARE WATCHING** üõë
The smart-lint.sh hook will verify EVERYTHING. It will:
- Block operations if you ignore linter warnings
- Track repeated violations
- Prevent commits with any issues
- Force you to fix problems before proceeding

**Completion Standards (NOT NEGOTIABLE):**
- The task is NOT complete until ALL linters pass with zero warnings (PHPStan/Larastan with all checks enabled)
- ALL tests must pass with meaningful coverage of business logic (Pest for Laravel applications)
- The feature must be fully implemented and working end-to-end
- No placeholder comments, TODOs, or "good enough" compromises
- Code follows Laravel conventions and uses Livewire/Filament patterns correctly

**Reality Checkpoints (MANDATORY):**
- After EVERY 3 file edits: Run linters
- After implementing each component: Validate it works
- Before saying "done": Run FULL test suite
- If hooks fail: STOP and fix immediately

**Code Evolution Rules:**
- This is a feature branch - implement the NEW solution directly
- DELETE old code when replacing it - no keeping both versions
- NO migration functions, compatibility layers, or deprecated methods
- NO versioned function names (e.g., processDataV2, processDataNew)
- When refactoring, replace the existing implementation entirely
- If changing an API, change it everywhere - no gradual transitions

**Language-Specific Quality Requirements:**

**For ALL languages:**
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Use language-appropriate linters at MAX strictness
- Delete old code when replacing functionality
- No compatibility shims or transition helpers

**For Laravel/PHP specifically:**
- Absolutely NO raw SQL queries - use Eloquent or Query Builder
- NO direct $_GET/$_POST access - use Laravel request validation
- Type hints on ALL methods and properties
- Follow Laravel conventions and naming patterns
- NO database queries in Livewire render methods
- NO polling in Livewire/Filament - use Laravel Reverb + Echo for real-time updates
- NO inline comments within methods - use self-documenting variable names
- NO class constants for labels/colors/icons - use Enum classes with methods
- Use Livewire actions for user interactions, not direct method calls
- Filament resources must follow standard patterns
- Keep controllers thin - delegate to services or actions
- Use proper Eloquent relationships with return types
- Follow Laravel project structure (app/, resources/, database/)
- Use Laravel Echo for real-time communication (local: https://<folder-name>.test)
- Let `composer refactor:annotate` handle docblocks - focus on clean code

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Reference specific sections of relevant documentation (e.g., "Per the Laravel documentation on Eloquent relationships...")
- Include links to official Laravel docs, Livewire docs, or Filament docs as needed
- Document WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT the code does

**Implementation Approach:**
- Start by outlining the complete solution architecture
- When modifying existing code, replace it entirely - don't create parallel implementations
- Run linters after EVERY file creation/modification
- If a linter fails, fix it immediately before proceeding
- Write meaningful tests for business logic, skip trivial tests for main() or simple wiring
- Benchmark critical paths

**Procrastination Patterns (FORBIDDEN):**
- "I'll fix the linter warnings at the end" ‚Üí NO, fix immediately
- "Let me get it working first" ‚Üí NO, write clean code from the start
- "This is good enough for now" ‚Üí NO, do it right the first time
- "The tests can come later" ‚Üí NO, test as you go
- "I'll refactor in a follow-up" ‚Üí NO, implement the final design now

**Specific Antipatterns to Avoid:**
- Do NOT use raw SQL queries - use Eloquent/Query Builder
- Do NOT access $_GET/$_POST directly - use Laravel request validation
- Do NOT keep old implementations alongside new ones
- Do NOT create "transition" or "compatibility" code
- Do NOT stop at "mostly working" - the code must be production-ready
- Do NOT accept any linter warnings as "acceptable" - fix them all
- Do NOT query databases in Livewire render methods
- Do NOT use direct method calls in Livewire - use actions instead
- Do NOT use polling in Livewire/Filament - use Laravel Reverb + Echo for real-time updates
- Do NOT implement manual refresh mechanisms - use broadcast events instead
- Do NOT add inline comments within methods - use clear variable names instead
- Do NOT use class constants for UI elements - use Enum classes with methods

**Completion Checklist (ALL must be ‚úÖ):**
- [ ] Research phase completed with codebase understanding
- [ ] Plan reviewed and approach validated  
- [ ] ALL linters pass with ZERO warnings
- [ ] ALL tests pass (including race detection where applicable)
- [ ] Feature works end-to-end in realistic scenarios
- [ ] Old/replaced code is DELETED
- [ ] Documentation/comments are complete
- [ ] Reality checkpoints were performed regularly
- [ ] NO TODOs, FIXMEs, or "temporary" code remains

**STARTING NOW** with research phase to understand the codebase...

(Remember: The hooks will verify everything. No excuses. No shortcuts.)
